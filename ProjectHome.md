This project is for students of F# who are reading functional programming books`*` that lack congruent code samples. The sample code found here attempts to reproduce as accurately as possible the source code from the books but this can be a serious challenge at times.

F# is closest in dialect to the [ML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_%28programming_language%29) family of languages--most notably [OCaml](http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/index.en.html). When constructs do not map directly to F#, care is taken to choose the F# code that best represents the constructs in the original language. At times, special features of F# may be used in a way that fits the example being reproduced. For example, consider the reproduction of a Binary Tree found [here](http://code.google.com/p/book-samples-in-fsharp/source/browse/trunk/PurelyFunctionalDataStructures-Okasaki/Chapter%202-Persistence/2.2%20Binary%20Search%20Tree.fs). This example uses the `ty : comparison` constraint but it is this author's opinion that it is used entirely in accordance with the book's original intent. Such cases are rare, however, and suggestions about how to most accurately reproduce an example are encouraged.

`*` Code examples are not, however, limited to functional programming texts.

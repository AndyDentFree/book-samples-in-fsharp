Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/book-samples-in-fsharp

I am not the original author.

I exported this because of the coming closing of Google Code, even though I may not have time for many months to add to these repos myself.

However, I'm very keen to expand my F# knowledge by porting these classic samples either filling in gaps in the starting collection or in making sure they run in current F#.

My main motivation is using F# with Xamarin on mobile, rather than desktop programming.
